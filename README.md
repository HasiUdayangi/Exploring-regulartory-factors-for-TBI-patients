# Exploring regulatory factors in traumatic brain injury (TBI) through Correlation Analysis and Graph Neural Network
This study aimed to uncover subtle interconnection between biomarker groups and identify the key factors contributing to TBI characteristics and ICU severity scores. A total of 29 patients with TBI who were admitted to the ICU were selected and analyzed using monitoring electrocardiography (ECG), vital signs, and electronic medical records. The Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores was used as a measure of severity in TBI patients. This study utilized a methodology that integrates correlation-based network analysis and graph neural network (GNN) techniques to uncover hidden relationships between various biomarkers and identify the most critical monitoring biomarkers for patients with TBI within the first 12 hours of ICU stay.
